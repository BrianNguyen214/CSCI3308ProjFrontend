We founded it on the principle that we could achieve something more and leave\n            a mark on the world with our own company rather than working for tech giants; in which the latter would further\n        monopolize and consolidate technological power to the hands of the few.</p>\n        <p class=\"aboutuspara\">We are currently building and polishing a plug and play drone delivery system for small to\n            medium sized retail and fast-food businesses. We believe that drone delivery will be the first widespread usage of\n            robotics in the United States that will interact with the public. For example, every time you order a pizza, you will be\n            interacting with a robot when it arrives. Robotics is the third leap in humanity's technological evolution after fire\n            and electricity, and we hope to be a segue into the age of widespread robots.</p>\n        <p class=\"aboutuspara\">With Udana, we will provide consistency and great performance for our customers. For example, an average delivery driver costs 1600 dollars a month, and he is obligated a tip from the customer,\n        he might drive intoxicated, or he might get into a crash. This is all bad news for your company. A Udana delivery drone, however,\n        flies straight through the air to the customer at 35 miles per hour, and doesn't have to wait for any traffic lights.\n        It never calls in sick and never makes the same mistakes as a human, which costs your business money.</p>\n            <h4 class=\"aboutus\" style=\"margin-top:3.4vh;\">Why Consider Us</h4>\n        <ol class=\"aboutuslist\">\n            <li ><p style=\"color:#2c3e50; font-size:2.3vmin\">We are a product driven company - We do not care about business metrics..</p></li>\n            <li ><p style=\"color:#2c3e50; font-size:2.3vmin\">Our drones deliver right to your clients' doors using SLAM and Machine Learning.</p></li>\n            <li ><p style=\"color:#2c3e50; font-size:2.3vmin\">We are a customer driven company - We can individually help all our clients because of our size.</p></li>\n            <li ><p style=\"color:#2c3e50; font-size:2.3vmin\">We have a passion for our product - The money will come - if the product is good.</p></li>\n        </ol>\n        <p class=\"aboutuspara\">Udana as a company is driven by two things: our product and our customers. We do not care about business metrics and quarterly goals,\n        because if our product is good, we believe that our business also will be. We do not operate like the other companies with complicated setup and partnership seeking;\n        there is no specific fine tuning required for your delivery drone application. Simply just follow our plug and play system and deliver right to the customer's door.</p>\n        <h4 class=\"members\">Members</h4>\n    </div>\n\n\n\n    <div v-for=\"(item,index) in items\" class=\"background\" :style=\"firststr+colors[Math.floor(Math.random()*colors.length)]+secondstr\">\n        <div class=\"grid\" >\n            <div class=\"item\">\n                <img :src='item[\"PictureLink\"]' class=\"profile\">\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"item2\">\n                <div class=\"Description\">\n                    <h4 class=\"des\" id=\"title\">{{item[\"Name\"]}} </h4>\n                    <h4 class=\"des\" id=\"position\"> {{item[\"Position\"]}}</h4>\n                    <p class=\"des\" id=\"descrip\">{{item[\"Description\"]}}</p>\n                    <span class=\"hack\"></span>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n",null]}
